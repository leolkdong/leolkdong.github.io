It is of great significance to obtain the precise spatial distribution of glycosylation modifications at cellular and tissue levels. Herein, we introduce LectoScape, a novel method enabling detailed imaging of the glycome in tissues at a resolution of up to 1 m through imaging mass cytometry (IMC). The selection of 12 non-overlapping lectins based on microarray technology allows for the multiplexed detection of various glycans. Moreover, we have developed an efficient labeling strategy for these lectins. Significantly, our approach enables the simultaneous imaging of a diverse range of glycan motifs from N-glycan, O-glycan, and glycolipid, which is not achievable by other technology. Through the application of LectoScape, we have successfully identitied distinct glycan structures in various cell types, leading to a deeper understanding of glycan distribution across human tissues. Remarkably, our method has identified α2,3 sialic acid and terminal GalNAc as diagnostic indicators for cervical intrepithelial neoplasia, showcasing the potential of this technique in cancer diagnosis by detecting abnormal glycosylation.","tags":null,"title":"LectoScape: A Highly Multiplexed Imaging Platform for Glycome Analysis and Biomedical Diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"M.Sc.

This manner neglects the diverse conditions in the pancancer and cancer subtypes of individual patients, resulting in suboptimal outcomes in diagnosis and treatment. To overcome this limitation, we shift from a blanket application of statistics to a focus on the explicit recognition of patient-specific abnormalities. Our objective is to use multiomics data to empower clinicians with personalized molecular descriptions that allow for customized diagnosis and interventions. Here, we propose a highly trustworthy multiomics learning (HTML) framework that employs multiomics self-adaptive dynamic learning to process each sample with data- dependent architectures and computational flows, ensuring personalized and trustworthy patient-centering of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Extensive testing on a 33-type pancancer dataset and 12 cancer subtype datasets underscored the superior performance of HTML compared with static-architecture-based methods. Our findings also highlighting the potential of HTML in elucidating complex biological pathogenesis and paving the way for improved patient-specific care in cancer treatment.","tags":null,"title":"Multiomics Dynamic Learning Enables Personalized Diagnosis and Prognosis for Pancancer and Cancer Subtypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhigao Shen","Cong Liu","Ziqian Wang","Fengfei Xie","Xingwu Liu","Lingkai Dong","Xuehua Pan","Chen Zeng","Peng George Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
